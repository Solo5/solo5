## 0.2.0 (2017-01-26)

This release is targeted for use with MirageOS 3.0.

High-level user-visible changes in this release:

* Support for building the `virtio` backend on FreeBSD.
* The `virtio` drivers are now stable and tested on QEMU/KVM, FreeBSD/bhyve and
  Google Compute Engine.
* A new option (`--net-mac`) for specifying a user-defined MAC address to `ukvm`.
* A new script [solo5-mkimage.sh](tools/mkimage/solo5-mkimage.sh) for building
  MBR-partitioned disk images with a bootloader and Solo5 (`virtio` backed)
  unikernel, with integrated support for building images for Google Compute
  Engine.
* A new script [solo5-run-virtio](tools/run/solo5-run-virtio.sh) for launching
  Solo5 (`virtio` backed) unikernels on QEMU/KVM and FreeBSD/bhyve.
* Improvements to the standalone test programs under `tests/`, including an
  automated test suite.
* Standardised license headers and copyright notices across the codebase and
  introduced an AUTHORS file listing contributors and their affiliations.

Notable changes under the hood:

* Security audit of the ukvm "hypercall" interfaces and ELF loader.
* Cleanup and refactoring of the low-level interrupt and trap handling code.
* Memory layout improvements and unification between the `ukvm` and `virtio`
  backends.
* Many bug fixes.
