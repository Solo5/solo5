# About Solo5

Solo5 is most useful as a "base layer" to run
[MirageOS](https://mirage.io/) unikernels, either on various existing
hypervisors (KVM/QEMU, Bhyve) or on a specialized "unikernel monitor" called
`ukvm`.

# About ukvm

`ukvm` runs as a Linux process and uses KVM.  The goal of `ukvm` is to
be a small, modular monitor, in which its functionality and interfaces
are customized to the unikernel that is being built.  In other words,
the unikernel monitor exhibits the characteristic of "only what is
needed" for the unikernel to run.  It has the potential to provide a
thinner interface to the guest unikernel (thinner than either a
container or a VM), a simpler I/O interface (e.g., packet send rather
than virtio), and better performance due to its simplicity (e.g., fast
boot). Check out our
[paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotcloud16/hotcloud16_williams.pdf)

# Building Mirage/Solo5 unikernels

These instructions assume that you have an OCaml (4.02.3 or newer)
development environment with the OPAM package manager installed. If you
are developing with Docker, you can use the one of the pre-built
`ocaml/opam` [images](https://hub.docker.com/r/ocaml/opam/).

Mirage/Solo5 supports two different targets to `mirage configure`:

1. `ukvm`: A specialized "unikernel monitor" which runs on Linux
   (`x86_64`) and uses KVM directly via `/dev/kvm`.
2. `virtio`: An `x86_64` system with `virtio` network and disk
   interfaces. Use this target for QEMU/KVM, plain QEMU, Bhyve or other
   hypervisors (see below).

Start with a fresh OPAM switch for the Mirage/Solo5 target you will be
using: (If you are using the pre-built Docker images you can skip this
step.)

    opam switch --alias-of 4.03.0 mirage-solo5-dev

While Solo5 support has been merged into upstream MirageOS, this has not
yet been officially released. To use the latest development version of
MirageOS you will need to add the `mirage-dev` OPAM repository:

    opam repo add mirage-dev git://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev

Install the MirageOS frontend:

    opam depext -i mirage

Clone the MirageOS example applications repository (`mirage-dev` branch):

    git clone -b mirage-dev https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton

Build the `stackv4` example:

    cd mirage-skeleton/stackv4
    mirage configure -t ukvm
    make

This will build the unikernel as `mir-stackv4.ukvm` (with a `ukvm-bin`
in the same directory) or `mir-stackv4.virtio`, depending on which
target you selected.

# Running Mirage/Solo5 unikernels directly

These examples show how to run Mirage/Solo5 unikernels directly.  If
you'd like to use Docker instead, skip to the next section.

**Setting up**

The following examples assume you have successfully built the MirageOS
`stackv4` application, and use the default networking configuration for
the unikernel (a static IP address of `10.0.0.2/24`). Run the `stackv4`
unikernel with an argument of `--help=plain` to see the options for
modifying this. By convention, we will use the `tap100` interface to talk to
the unikernel.

To set up the `tap100` interface on Linux, run (as root):

    ip tuntap add tap100 mode tap
    ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev tap100
    ip link set dev tap100 up

To set up Bhyve and the `tap100` interface on FreeBSD, run (as root):

    kldload vmm
    kldload if_tap
    kldload nmdm
    sysctl -w net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
    ifconfig tap100 create 10.0.0.1/24 link0 up

**Running with ukvm on Linux**

A specialized monitor called `ukvm-bin` is generated as part of the
build process, so the command line arguments may differ depending on
the needs of the unikernel.  To see the arguments, run `ukvm-bin` with
no arguments or `--help`.

To launch the unikernel:

    ./ukvm-bin --net=tap100 ./mir-stackv4.ukvm

Use `^C` to terminate the unikernel.

**Running with KVM/QEMU on Linux, or Bhyve on FreeBSD**

To launch the unikernel:

    solo5-run-virtio -n tap100 ./mir-stackv4.virtio

Use `^C` to terminate the unikernel.

The [solo5-run-virtio](tools/run/solo5-run-virtio.sh) script is automatically
installed in your `$PATH` when using the `solo5-kernel-virtio` OPAM package.
Using it is not required; by default it will print the commands used to setup
and launch the guest VM. You can run these manually if desired.

**Running virtio unikernels with other hypervisors**

The `virtio` target produces a unikernel that uses the multiboot
protocol for booting. If your hypervisor can boot a multiboot-compliant
kernel directly then this is the preferred method.

If your hypervisor requires a full disk image to boot, you can use the
[solo5-mkimage](tools/mkimage/solo5-mkimage.sh) tool to build one. This tool is
automatically installed in your `$PATH` when using the `solo5-kernel-virtio`
OPAM package.

`solo5-mkimage` supports the following image formats:

* `raw`: A raw disk image, written out as a sparse file.
* `tar`: A disk image suitable for [uploading to](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/building-images#publishingimage) Google Compute Engine.

The following devices are supported by the Solo5 `virtio` target:

* the serial console, fixed at COM1 and 115200 baud
* the KVM paravirtualized clock, if available
* a single virtio network device attached to the PCI bus
* a single virtio block device attached to the PCI bus

Note that Solo5 on virtio does not support ACPI power-off. This can manifest
itself in delays shutting down Solo5 guests running on hypervisors which wait
for the guest to respond to ACPI power-off before performing a hard shutdown.

# Running Mirage/Solo5 unikernels with Docker

[Unikernel runner](https://github.com/mato/docker-unikernel-runner)
integrates seamlessly with Docker networking and runs the unikernel and
`ukvm` in a container. Running the `stackv4` example is as simple as:

    docker run -ti --rm \
        --device=/dev/kvm:/dev/kvm \
        --device=/dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun \
        --cap-add=NET_ADMIN mir-stackv4-ukvm

Refer to the
[documentation](https://github.com/mato/docker-unikernel-runner/blob/master/README.md)
for details.

# Developing Solo5 and ukvm

If you'd like to develop Solo5, ukvm and/or investigate porting other
unikernels to use Solo5 as a base layer, the public APIs are defined in
`kernel/solo5.h` and `ukvm/ukvm.h`. These interfaces are still evolving
and subject to change.

We also have some simple standalone unikernels written in C to test
Solo5, see `tests` for these.

The coding style for this project is "Linux with 4 spaces instead of
tabs".  The modified `checkpatch.pl` script helps give hints about
what violates this style.

The best place for Mirage-related discussions about Solo5 and/or
`ukvm` is to post to the [MirageOS-devel mailing list](http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel),
with general Solo5/`ukvm` discussions on <https://devel.unikernel.org/>.

# Debugging on ukvm

You can debug the unikernel running in ukvm using gdb, but need to
build a `ukvm-bin` with gdb support.  To do so, edit the Makefile
(generated in the case of Mirage), and add `gdb` to the `UKVM_MODULES`
make variable.  Then, running `make ukvm-bin` should build a version
with gdb support.

Start ukvm with the `--gdb` flag, like this:

    ./ukvm-bin mir-console.solo5-ukvm --gdb

And then from another console start gdb and connect to the remote target
listening at `localhost:1234`:

    $ gdb mir-console.solo5-ukvm

    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234

Here is a typical gdb session:

    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
    Remote debugging using localhost:1234
