 *
 * For APIs returning a solo5_result_t:

 *   Unless otherwise documented below, these APIs return only SOLO5_R_OK on
 *   success.
 *
 *   Application developers MUST NOT RELY on these APIs returning
 *   SOLO5_R_EINVAL or SOLO5_R_EUNSPEC. Solo5 implementations MAY choose to
 *   abort execution of the application in preference to returning an error
 *   result on failure.
 *
 * For APIs NOT returning a solo5_result_t:
 *
 *   These APIs either:
 *
 *   a) always succeed under normal operation, or
 *   b) abort execution of the application on failure.
 *
 * For the avoidance of doubt, calling APIs on devices that are not present
 * WILL result in aborting execution of the application.
