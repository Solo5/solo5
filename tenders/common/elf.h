 * simplify parsing, this function only supports PT_NOTE headers containing a
 * *single* NOTE descriptor. Refer to the Solo5 linker scripts for how to
 * produce ELF binaries using this scheme.
 *
 * Returns / error handling:
 *
 * On success: Returns 0 and memory for the note descriptor (content) is
 * allocated with malloc(), returned in (*note_data), with the note size,
 * **minus any alignment**, returned in (*note_size).
 *
 * If a Solo5-owned NOTE of (note_type) was NOT found, but the executable is
 * otherwise valid: Returns -1.
