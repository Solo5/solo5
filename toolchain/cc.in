# @@CONFIG_TARGET_TRIPLE@@-cc: Solo5 wrapper for 'cc'.
# Generated by configure.sh at build time.
#
# Passes through to @@CONFIG_TARGET_CC@ for actual work. Defines all flags
# required for correct operation when building C code intended for inclusion in
# a Solo5 unikernel.
#
# Provides a '-z solo5-abi=ABI' option to select the Solo5 bindings to use if
# linking. ABI defaults to 'stub' to accomodate non-Solo5-aware build systems,
# such as GNU autoconf, which use 'cc'-as-linker to test for the presence of
# symbols.
